    "USAA wants to better understand the liability associated with their customers' accidents in order to determine the premiums they should be charging. As one of the country's biggest metropolitan areas with a variety of weather conditions, Chicago is a prime candidate for studying auto accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company hired a team of data scientists to study the primary cause of these accidents, which will provide insight on whether their customers' premiums should be adjusted. Furthermore, the team's research should make the company more aware of what conditions contribute most to predicting accident causes.\n",

In other words, it is best at predicting whether a crash is primarily caused by ignoring traffic signs & warnings, and worst at predicting whether a crash is primarily caused by impairment/distraction."

    "- **If a client's accident cause is determined to be 'Ignoring Traffic Signs & Warnings': Consider increasing their premium.**\n",
    "- **If a client's accident cause is determined to be 'Outside Hazard': Consider minimal or no increase to the premium, as the accident has been caused by something out of the client's control.** \n",
    "- **If a client's accident cause is determined to be 'Reckless Driving': Consider increasing their premium.** Additionally, flag the client as a candidate to drop if the reckless driving continues. It is harder to write off such causes as accidental or momentary, like one conceivably could with 'Ignoring Traffic Signs & Warnings.'\n",
    "- **If a client's accident cause is determined to be 'Impairment/Distraction': Do not make any conclusions about the case, and use the prediction as a prompt to investigate more closely.** This is due to both the class' poor performance metrics & its relative ambiguity ('Impairment/Distraction' covers everything from drunk driving to medical emergencies while operating a vehicle)"
